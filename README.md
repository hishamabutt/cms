I have created a clinic management system using MERN Stack. In this system Admin can add user,Test ,Doctors and can upload report of the user. When user is created system automaticlly provide the key and the password for that user with which he/she can use to get his/her report.
Every Data is stored is database (mongoDB). I have also Implemented authentication using JWT and password is hashed using bcryptjs. Validation is done using express-validationa and file is saved using express-fileupload.
